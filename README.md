# sf-automation-switch

This script helps with disabling and enabling automation (Triggers, Validation Rules and Flows) in a Salesforce org, especially useful for data migrations.

## ****How to Install and run the script****

- Make sure you have the following installed in your local machine:
    - Salesforce CLI
    - Python 3.5 or later
- Install the following packages, global or virtual environment (preferred)
    - simple_salesforce - https://github.com/simple-salesforce/simple-salesforce
    - python-dotenv - https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv
    - marshmallow - https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow
    - marshmallow_enum - https://github.com/justanr/marshmallow_enum
- Setup `.env` file at the root level. Example:
    
    ```bash
    SFUSERNAME=user@email.com.dev
    SFPASSWORD=00000000000
    SECURITY_TOKEN=0000000000000000000000000
    SFORGALIAS= abc_sfdev
    SALESFORCE_API_VERSION=XX.0
    ```
    
### How to Run:

`disable_automation` and `enable_automation` trigger the logic in the script. If `disable_automation` is true, it will attempt to disable Triggers, Validation Rules and Flows in your org. Similarly toggling `enable_automation`  to `True` will enable Triggers, Validation Rules and Flows in your org. Nothing happen if itâ€™s `False`.
